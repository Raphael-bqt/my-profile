		<p>Hi there. My name is Rapahel Bocquet. I love bilboquet. I'm 18, and 19 soon. I love sport in general, I'm very polyvalent. What I love the most is studying in my wonderful school: IESEG.</p>

		<h2>KARATE</h2>
			<p>I practice martial arts since the age of 3. What I really like in this sport is violence. I love fighting against others. It changes from eveyday life.</p>

		<h2>LITTERATURE</h2>
		<p>I love reading. If I had the time, I could read for hours, even during entire days. Unfortunately, I have to study and so I can't read. I love Victor Hugo as well as Celine. I like learning poems too.</p>

		<h2>SCUBA DIVING</h2>
			<p>I have not a lot of oportunities to do it, but when I can, I love to suba dive. The most excentric place where I've been to practice was the Seine in the center of Paris, whith some friends.</p>
